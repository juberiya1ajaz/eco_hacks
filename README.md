# Co-Shield

## üí° Inspiration

Most of the time we ran into the problem of unavailability of doctors and this thing was quite recurrent during the time of COVID-19. The matter is more concerning when we do not know what is happening to us. Co-Shield is a web application where users can take a Covid-19 Prediction test by uploading their chest X-ray test to check if they have Covid or not. We have provided a secure payment method with which you can buy our products. You can also talk to a doctor whenever you want from the comfort of your home. <br>
There is also a chatroom for users so that they can talk with fellow users and reduce the burden of their loneliness. The application will help people in need of medical care and supervision to understand the implications of different diseases in a very intuitive way. It will also help people find the right medical care/supervision.

## üíª What it does

Co-Shield is a web application where you can:

- Chatrooms
- Shop products
- Read and write blogs
- Take a COVID'19 prediction
- Get in touch with a doctor from the comfort of your home anytime.

## üåê Best Use of Velo by Wix - MLH

I have to build a website using Velo by Wix. Wix Velo is a full-stack development platform that allows you to create a website without coding knowledge. It is an excellent tool for beginners who want to learn how to code, and for experienced developers who want to build a website quickly. And we are using the following features of Wix

- **Wix Code**: Helps to add some custom code for implementing NLP for the diary page.
