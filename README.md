# Co-Shield

## üí° Inspiration
Most of the time we ran into the problem of unavailability of doctors and this thing was quite recurrent during the time of COVID-19. The matter is more concerning when we do not know what is happening to us. Co-Shield is a web application where users can take a Covid-19 Prediction test by uploading their chest X-ray test to check if they have Covid or not. There are many other tests available which you can opt to quickly know whether your symptoms are concerning or not. These tests include Blood-test, Antibody tests and you can also buy a flu shot as well. We have provided a secure payment method with which you can buy our products. You can also talk to a doctor whenever you want from the comfort of your home. <br>
The most worrisome thing that happened during Covid-19 times was the spike in results of depression and mental health diseases and the lockdown had made it worse. According to various research COVID-19 patients are at an increased risk of being diagnosed with anxiety, depression, or insomnia. The study, published in **The Lancet Psychiatry**, analyzed the electronic health records of 69.8 million patients in the United States, which included 62,354 patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Within three months of testing positive, **almost 20% of people diagnosed with COVID-19 were then diagnosed with psychiatric disorders, including anxiety, depression, or insomnia**. One in four of those people had not received a psychiatric diagnosis before. The researchers warned that the results are likely to be underestimates of the actual number of cases. To combat this issue we have provided a mental health checkup with the help of NLP that. There is also a chatroom for users so that they can talk with fellow users and reduce the burden of their loneliness. The application will help people in need of medical care and supervision to understand the implications of different diseases in a very intuitive way. It will also help people find the right medical care/supervision.
